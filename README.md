Challenges:
    The concept of the GET and POST methods was very hard to grasp. It took me some time to test and have an understanding how these methods work. After tinkering and testing each methods, I realized that they resemble functions wherein the parameters are expressed in a different way. Then I used the appendfilesync that I learned in the last exercise to create txt file that will store each book entries. For the GET method, I had a hard time processing how to convert the entries in the text file iand store it into an array. After thorough searching I was able to learn the readfilesync that is the opposite of the appendfilesync. Once I got familiarized with the function. The other components such as the filtering function by author and isbn were easier to execute.
